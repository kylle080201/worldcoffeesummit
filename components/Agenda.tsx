                            <h3>Carbon markets are carbon pricing mechanisms enabling governments and non-state actors to trade greenhouse gas emission credits. The aims are to achieve climate targets and implement climate actions cost-effectively. Integrating biodiversity targets into corporate sustainability strategy is crucial. Ensuring that smallholder farmers can effectively participate in carbon markets can help improve production, adapt to climate change, and increase income. Carbon markets have shown great potential to finance climate action on coffee farms and achieve carbon neutrality if small-scale farmers are able to participate.</h3>
