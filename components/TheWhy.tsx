                            There are several key problems in the current supply chain that leads to
                            the farmer only seeing a small profit percentage for his or her hard work,
                            and the consumer, the end user, who pays a premium price for their caffeine.
                            On average,  it takes six months for coffee to make it into a cup. Over the time
                            the coffee degrades. Speeding up the supply chain and removing layers of bureaucracy
                            should result in better coffee at a cheaper price fairer to the coffee producers.

                            Digitalization creates a paradigm shift in the coffee industry and can be a game
                            changer. Payments could be speeded up considerably using blockchain.
                            Smart contracts could see an end to interoperability
                            and the endless piles of paper used to move
                            coffee from farm to retailer.

                            Blockchain&apos;s strength is that it can be trusted, and business can be
                            conducted faster. This streaming will not only make transactions more direct
                            and transparent, it will also see fewer errors occurring along the way. This
                            should not only speed up lead times, but this should also see the need for
                            middlemen become obsolete.

                            Coffee prices are vulnerable to swings in the
                            commodity market. Farmers require

                            supply chain. Their data is essential in
